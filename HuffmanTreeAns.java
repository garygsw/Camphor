/*
 * This Exercise is to walk through the solution of the problem on Huffman Tree construction.
 * You want to build a custom Huffman tree for a particular file. Your input will consist of an array of objects
 * such that each object contains a reference to a symbol occurring in that file and the frequency of occurrence (weight) 
 * for the symbol in that file.
 * 
 * Questions will be asked in a form of comment and the answer must be entered below it in the comment to make 
 * the resulting file remains as compilable. Marks allocated to questions are shown and marks given will be stated.
 * Total Marks allocated: 31
 * Total marks obtained:

 * There are several compelling reasons for using nested classes, among them:
 * 1) It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place.
